# ========================================
# VaultPlugin Configuration
# ========================================

# ------------------ Vault Costs ------------------
# Set the cost for each vault. Vault numbers are 1-based.
# Example: Vault #1 costs 100.0, Vault #2 costs 250.0, Vault #3 costs 10000
# Note: Commas will not work, just dont do it...
vault-costs:
  1: 100.0
  2: 250.0
  3: 10000

# ------------------ Instructions ------------------
# How to add a new vault:
# 1. Add a new entry under "vault-costs" with the vault number and cost.
#    Example:
#       4: 750.0
# 2. Vault numbers must be consecutive if you want a clean selector layout.
# 3. The plugin supports up to 28 vault slots in the selector page (rows 1-4, columns 1-7).
# 4. Players can unlock vaults by paying the amount defined here.
# 5. Non-existent vault numbers will appear as black filler in the vault selector.

# ------------------ Vault Limits ------------------
# Maximum vaults per player: 28
# Selector page slots: 54 (outer border white glass, inner 28 vault slots)
# Storage page slots: 27 (inside vault inventory)
# Filler protection: All filler items are fully protected; players cannot move or pick them up.

# ------------------ Unlocked Vaults ------------------
# This section is managed automatically by the plugin.
# Each UUID maps to a list of unlocked vault indexes (0-based internally)
# Example:
# unlocked:
#   "player-uuid-1": [0, 1]  # Vault #1 and #2 unlocked
#   "player-uuid-2": [0]

unlocked: {}
